# 13 Object Relational Mapping (ORM): E-commerce Back End

I the last several years e-commerce industry exceeded all expectation and have been steadily growing.  Demand for the web developers in the internet retail space is very strong and is continuously growing. This project highlights the e-commerce platform that is widely used in the industry.  The app is implementing most current technologies like Express.js API, Sequelize and MySQL Database. The data is transferred between the front and back end of the website using the routes.


## User Story

```md
Retail companies are looking to establish the e-commerce website <br/>
that uses the latest technologies. Retail companies have compete <br/>
with other e-commerce companies in the internet space due to multiple <br/>
channels of availability of the products and steep competition.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## Mock-Up

The following animations show examples of the application's API routes being tested in Insomnia.

The first animation shows GET routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia:

![In Insomnia, the user tests “GET tags"]

![“GET Categories”]

The second animation shows GET routes to return a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia:

![In Insomnia, the user tests “GET tag by id,” “GET Category by ID,” and “GET One Product.”]

The final animation shows the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories being tested in Insomnia:

![In Insomnia, the user tests “DELETE Category by ID,” “CREATE Category,” and “UPDATE Category.”]

The video shows the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for products and tags being tested in Insomnia.

## Getting Started

You’ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and
Terminal command: `npm i mysql2`

[Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your
Terminal line command: `npm i sequelize`

Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

Terminal line command `npm i dotenv`

Use the `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder to create your database using MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

### Database Models

Your database should contain the following four models, including the requirements listed for each model:

- `Category`

  - `id`

    - Integer
    - Doesn't allow null values
    - Set as primary key
    - Uses auto increment

  - `category_name`
    - String
    - Doesn't allow null values

- `Product`

  - `id`

    - Integer
    - Doesn't allow null values
    - Set as primary key
    - Uses auto increment

  - `product_name`

    - String
    - Doesn't allow null values

  - `price`

    - Decimal
    - Doesn't allow null values
    - Validates that the value is a decimal

  - `stock`

    - Integer
    - Doesn't allow null values
    - Set a default value of 10
    - Validates that the value is numeric

  - `category_id`
    - Integer
    - References the `category` model's `id`

- `Tag`

  - `id`

    - Integer
    - Doesn't allow null values
    - Set as primary key
    - Uses auto increment

  - `tag_name`
    - String

- `ProductTag`

  - `id`

    - Integer
    - Doesn't allow null values
    - Set as primary key
    - Uses auto increment

  - `product_id`

    - Integer
    - References the `product` model's `id`

  - `tag_id`
    - Integer
    - References the `tag` model's `id`

### Associations

You'll need to execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:

- `Product` belongs to `Category`, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

- `Category` has many `Product` models.

- `Product` belongs to many `Tag` models. Using the `ProductTag` through model, allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products.

- `Tag` belongs to many `Product` models.

**Hint**: Make sure you set up foreign key relationships that match the column we created in the respective models.

### Fill out the API Routes to Perform RESTful CRUD Operations

Fill out the unfinished routes in `product-routes.js`, `tag-routes.js`, and `category-routes.js` to perform create, read, update, and delete operations using your Sequelize models.

**Note**: The functionality for creating the many-to-many relationship for products is already done for you.

**Hint**: Be sure to look at your module project's code for syntax help and use your model's column definitions to figure out what `req.body` will be for POST and PUT routes!

### Seed the Database

After creating the models and routes, run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

### Sync Sequelize to the Database on Server Start

Create the code needed in `server.js` to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.

## Review

You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

- A walkthrough video demonstrating the functionality of the application and all of the acceptance criteria being met.

- The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.
